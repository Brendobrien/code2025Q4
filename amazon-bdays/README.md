### BUG

```
cacton@alumni.nd.edu - ERROR
pgfsligo@oh.rr.com - ERROR
"Email address must contain a domain, like chris@example.com"
```

```
Happy Bday Caroline from Brendan O
NOTE: Kevin forward this to Caroline for me.
For some reason, her email "cactonATalumniDOTndDOTedu"
wasn't being accepted by amazon's form validation.
